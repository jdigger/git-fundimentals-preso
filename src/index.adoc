== What's in a name?

Names are important...

[.cue]
****
There are names, and then there are NAMES.

"Jim" is a great name. Doesn't tell you much about me, but is "generally" useful for identifying me distinctly from others in a room.

"Jim Moore" is even better. Not only does it further decrease the likelihood that there will be others with the same name in a room, it also tells you a bit about my ancestory. (From the moors of Ireland.) Though at one point in my career there were four "Jim Moore"s in the same company, and my office was right next door to one of the other Jim Moores: a really cool guy that was under five feet and black as night -- which is not me, even though HR and Accounting would constantly confuse us since we were even in the same department.

Wouldn't it be cooler if we still did names like they did in the medival period based on more INHERENT qualities? Maybe mine would be "Jim the Byte-Binder of Denver, eldest of James the Shapesmaster and Judy the Wise." Now THAT would be a name less likely to be duplicated...
****

== How do we want to identify the content we just created?

* We want some way to keep track of content *_and_* know when that content has _changed_.
* _Ideally_ in a way where that name/identifier would survive context shifts (such as being copied)

[%build]
== !Name Options

[build=self]
* File name?
* File name (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name[URN]?) and modification time?
* A self-incrementing revision number?

image:ugh-as-if.png[role="build-items"]

== Solution

We're going to give it a name based on its *_content_* rather than something effectively random.

== !Hash Function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function[*Hash function*] -- any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.

== Naming the Content

[.generic-codeblock]

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,quotes"]

$ *git hash-object file1.txt*

63ffb2bff74e9161a82b82999718f441df6a68f1

$ *git hash-object morefiles/file3.txt*
77bd771f7fefc66994a22d922cad923ae068675a
----

****
* The hash uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[the SHA-1 algorithm], producing a 160 bit (40 hex characters) representation of the data
* Hashes for *_exactly_* the same content are the same; for different content (even a single bit) the hash is radically different

== !DAG03

image:dag03.png[]

== The Power of Guarantees

Because each object's content has a pointer to the one below, a change in a sub-object guarantees that the hash for the parent will be different

== Merkle Trees

For the developers/computer-science people, this is an extremely well-proven technique known as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree[hash tree (a.k.a. Merkle tree)]

Instead of using pointers comprised of memory addresses, it uses pointers using a unique "name" based upon the referenced value's *_contents_*


== !Efficient Data Integrity

image:raindow_dash_with_armor_vector_by_pegasi_pony-d4jhgkc.png[role="rainbow-dash-armor"]

It is used as a highly efficient way to guarantee data integrity for everything from filesystems and databases (e.g., http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page[ZFS], https://github.com/basho/riak[Riak], https://cassandra.apache.org/[Casandra]) to peer-to-peer data transfer (e.g., http://www.bittorrent.com/[BitTorrent]) to currencies (e.g., https://bitcoin.org/en/[Bitcoin])


== Direction of the Arrows

The DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based on hashes is what makes it possible for git to be fully distributed

* Blobs are shared between Trees
* Trees are shared among Commits
* Commits are shared among References


== !Same and Different

image:same_different_ponies.jpg[]

Because identical content hashes to the same thing, and you have all of the content all of the time, it's trivial to do the consistency checks needed to know *exactly* _where, when and how_ content diverged

This is true *even among systems with no communication between them*

There is no need to know how you're going to want to slice-n-dice that information ahead of time


== Moving Files

It "`noticed`" that we renamed the file and directory...

How, since nothing in the data-structures recorded that?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7938582/how-does-git-detect-similar-files-for-its-rename-detection[Some of the porcelain uses rename detection] based on configurable sensitivity.

Because it's easily detectable at runtime, some of the porcelain, such as [source bash]+git blame -M+ can show how individual lines have moved around between files.

== Not Storing Deltas or Patches?

Each file, as we saw before, is a "`complete blob`" in git's object store

== Constant Time

Notice that navigating between revisions is an O(1) operation

Writing to the repository is extremely fast: no matter how many files there are, it's just enough time to calculate the SHA-1s of the new content, zlib compress it, and copy just that new content into the object store

----

== The Index

The portal between the working-directory and the repository

== Use Cases

* Want to be able to add some files but not all to a specific commit.
* Want to be able to add some parts of a file to a commit, but not others.
* Want to be able to "`move`" the commit pointer without affecting the files in the working directory.
** "`Oops, I didn't mean to commit the password file. Let's try that again.`"
** "`Oops. I had a typo in the commit message.`"
** "`Oops...`"
** Improving the readability/understandability of the project's history
** A desire to project the illusion of undeserved competence


== !Indirection

""
All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.
""
-- David Wheeler, http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/inbook/beautiful_code/html/Spi07g.html[Beautiful Code]

== !To the Index

Thus, instead of just the Working Directory and the Repository, there is also the **Index**

(a.k.a. the Dir Cache, Staging Area, etc.)

== Lifecycle

Working directory -> Index -> Tree -> Commit


== Manipulating the Index

* [source bash]+git add file+ and [source bash]+git rm file+ - adds and removes files from the index
* [source bash]+git add -p file+ - add a "`patch`" from this file, allowing selection of specific pieces of the file and not the whole thing
** While this can be done at the command line, this is really something that a graphical tool like http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[SourceTree] makes *_much_* easier
* [source bash]+git reset HEAD~1+ - move the index to what it looked like before the last commit, but leave the files as they were (i.e., "`forget`" that [source bash]+git commit+ happened)
* [source bash]+git reset --hard HEAD+ - move the index *and* filesystem to what it looked like at the last commit (very commonly done to toss away every that's been done since the last commit because of a bad rabbit trail)

The big difference between branches and tags is that the value in that file *_will change_* over time during a normal workflow. (i.e., As you make changes to the branch.)

== Mutability

== !Immutable

*The contents of "`objects`" can never change.*

*Period.*

== !Changes change the hash

Changing an object changes its hash, thereby guaranteeing consistency

== !References may change

"`References`" may change, which is why they don't have a hash


== HEAD

"`HEAD`" (.git/HEAD) is not really a "`reference`"

It's used as part of the porcelain to keep track of where the "`user`" is

== !Detached HEAD

image::mlp_10detached_parts_dried1.jpg[role="detached-head"]

A "`detached HEAD`" is simply a HEAD that points to a specific commit instead of a branch


== Revision IDs

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23303549/what-are-commit-ish-and-tree-ish-in-git[A great explanation on Stackoverflow.]

Some primary examples:

[.revids]
sha1:: a specific hash reference
refname:: branch name, tag, HEAD, etc.
rev^:: the parent of the commit
* "`master^`" is the parent of the commit pointed to by the head of "`master`"
rev~_n_:: the n^th^ parent of the commit.
* "HEAD~1" is the parent of the commit pointed to by HEAD
* "HEAD~5" goes back five commits before the current one

== Applying Changes

== !Git Add

[source bash]+++git add _filename_+++

The process:

. Compare the working-directory hash of the file to what is in the index
. If the hashes are different, copy the file into the object store as a new blob
. Record the hash for the file in the Index (a.k.a., "`tree builder`")

image:agent_oso.png[role="agent-oso"]


== !Git Commit

[source bash]+++git commit -m "_message_"+++

The process:

. Write the Index out as a tree object
. Create a commit object that has the tree's hash and meta-data (author, date, comment, etc.)
. Update the head of the branch pointed to by HEAD


== !Git Checkout

[source bash]+++git checkout _branchname_+++

The process:

. Replace the Index with the tree for the commit
. Update the local filesystem to match the Index
. Change HEAD to point to the branch

== !Git Cherrypick

[source bash]+++git cherry-pick _rev_+++

The process:

. [source bash]+++git diff -C _rev_~1 _rev_+++ -> patch
. Apply patch to the current HEAD
. Create a new commit, copying over the metadata (such as "`author`") from the cherry-picked commit


== Merging and Rebasing


== Merge

A new commit object is created with two parents

(more parents are possible, but don't do it)

== !Merge Process

[source bash]+++git merge _rev_+++

The process:

. The trees of both parents are examined, finding their common parent
** Identical trees/blobs (both hashes of are the same) are added to the Index
** A consistency check is done from their common parent to detect if both have added or removed files
** Perform three-way merges on changes, creating new blobs and adding their hashes to the Index
. Generate a new tree from the Index
. Create Commit

== Interactive Rebase

Using the "-i" flag allows you to "step into" the cherry-pick process

You can:

* pick which commits to use, including reordering or discarding specific commits
* edit the commit message of a commit
* pause while cherry-picking to allow editing the commit (such as breaking one commit into multiple commits, or removing mistakingly committed testing config or a sensitive file)
* "`squash`" a commit into a previous commit, merging them together
